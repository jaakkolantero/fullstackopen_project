Here are my first thought on this project. I descripe how I'm going to implement/build different parts of the app.

I still haven't decided what cms to use but checkout and kitchen features will be created from scratch and will use Graphql as backend(propably FaunaDB). For the actual page content I think I need some kind of CMS. Haven't figured out that yet.

## Workflow (for my personal usage)

1. Create draft with figma
2. mock in to react
3. create as good Graphql schema you can based on mock.
4. mock graphql data
5. add logic to react.
6. add final touches (animations etc)
7. write tests
8. write graphql server
9. start from the beginnning

## 27.11.

So yesterday learned some figma and created draft for the restaurant page. Didn't add any colors at this point. Still some features missing like Titles and footer but going to create a mock for this draft and iterate from there.
